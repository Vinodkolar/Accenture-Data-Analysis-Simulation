INSIGHTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
1. To maximize audience engagement, prioritize photo-based content in your marketingstrategy, as data shows that visual posts consistently drive higher interaction rates compared to other content types.
2. Encourage user-generated content (UGC) in high-engagement categories like Animals, Science, Healthy Eating, Technology, and Food. This will boost interaction, strengthen brand loyalty, and increase organic reach, ultimately enhancing the effectiveness of digital campaigns.
3. Align marketing campaigns and content initiatives with peak user activity periods, focusing on May and January when content uploads are highest. Plan strategies to boost engagement during slower months like February to maintain consistent user interaction and platform activity.
